## Sharpen Your Multiplication Skills

Welcome to Math Mastery, the ultimate tool to help you conquer multiplication tables in a fun and engaging way! Whether you are a student looking to boost your math skills or just someone who loves a good challenge, Math Mastery is here to guide you on your journey to multiplication mastery.

## How It Works

### 1. Unique Questions Every Time
Math Mastery ensures that no multiplication problem is repeated until all have been attempted at least once. This means you’ll always face fresh challenges and a variety of problems to solve.

### 2. Rewarding Persistence
If you answer a problem correctly three times, it won’t be repeated for the rest of the game. This feature helps you focus on areas that need more practice while rewarding your mastery of certain problems.

### 3. Color-Coded Progress
To make learning more interactive and visually rewarding:
- **Pink Square**: Correctly answer a problem on the first try, and the square turns pink.
- **Green Square**: If you answer a problem correctly two or three times in a row without any incorrect attempts, the square turns green.

### 4. Time-Bound Challenges
Each new question comes with a 3-second timer. This is designed to ensure you're learning to quickly recall multiplication facts, rather than calculating them in your head. When the timer runs out, the round ends, and you’ll know if you need to speed up.

### 5. Track Your Progress
Math Mastery keeps track of all your attempts, allowing you to monitor your progress easily. At any point, you can view detailed statistics about which problems you find easy and which ones are more challenging.

### 6. Visual Knowledge Graph
Our interactive knowledge graph shows your progress at a glance. Each cell represents a multiplication problem, and its color changes based on your performance:
- **White**: Not attempted yet.
- **Pink**: Solved correctly on the first try.
- **Green**: Solved correctly multiple times without any mistakes.

### 7. Challenge Yourself
At the end of each session, Math Mastery highlights the top 10 most challenging problems you encountered. This feature helps you focus on improving where it matters most.
